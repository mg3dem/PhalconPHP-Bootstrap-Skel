A simple skelleton for PhalconPHP with Volt, Bootstrap and FontAwesome for a single application.

This is an ongoing project, mostly targeted to my needs - if anyone finds this useful go ahead and use it however you want to. I will create another repository for a multi application starter ( front and back-end ) and hopefully will evolve it into a CMS that will let everyone control their website out of the box.

There are no .htaccess files since I use only nginx to serve my websites, so Apache users will have to grab those from phalconphp.com site - I will probably add them later on.
